# odin-recipes
 Intro
 
 This project is a website about recipes!
 
 I will try to use all the Html tags that i have learned up until now to create the website. At a later time i will visit this project again in order to style it with CSS!
 Once i am done with this project i would have demonstated that i know the basics of html and i can use Git ang Github to work on a project!
